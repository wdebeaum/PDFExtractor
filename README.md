# PDFExtractor #

PDFExtractor displays pages of PDF files, allows the user to select rectangular regions within those pages, extracts and searches text and tabular data within those regions, displays the extracted data tables, lets the user edit those tables to improve the quality of the extractions, and saves the tables as CSV or HTML. It uses [Tabula](https://tabula.technology/) (technically its backend, [tabula-java](https://github.com/tabulapdf/tabula-java)) for table extraction, and [Apache PDFBox](https://pdfbox.apache.org/) for reading and drawing PDF files.

This file is the README for the standalone version of PDFExtractor. The main documentation in [README.html](README.html) is written in the context of TRIPS. For the standalone version, `$TRIPS_BASE` is `trips-base/`.

## Build instructions ##

First, make sure you have a java compiler installed. Then build PDFExtractor itself. You can tell the configure script where various java-related executables are on your system if they're in non-standard locations:

    ./configure [--with-java=/path/to/java] [--with-javac=/path/to/javac] [--with-jar=/path/to/jar]
    make
    make install # installs to trips-base/etc/ and trips-base/bin/

## Run instructions ##

For standalone usage, you should give PDFExtractor the `-standalone` option:

    ./trips-base/bin/PDFExtractor -standalone

For the details of how to use it in this and other modes, see [README.html](README.html).
